    <h2>the first subject : <strong><mark> iraq history</strong> </mark></h2>
    <p id="p0">Iraq, a country located in <u><i><b>West Asia</b>,</u></i> largely coincides with the ancient region of Mesopotamia, often referred to as the
    cradle of civilization. The history of Mesopotamia extends back to the Lower Paleolithic period, with significant
    developments continuing through the establishment of the Caliphate in the late 7th century AD, after which the region
    became known as Iraq. Within its borders lies the ancient land of Sumer, which emerged between 6000 and 5000 BC during
    the Neolithic Ubaid period. Sumer is recognized as the world’s earliest civilization, marking the beginning of urban
    development, written language, and monumental architecture. Iraq's territory also includes the heartlands of the
    Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Neo-Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian empires, which dominated Mesopotamia and much of
    the Ancient Near East during the Bronze and Iron Ages. </p>

<h3 class="h2">Bronze Age</h3>
<p class="ppp">Main articles: Sumer, Akkadian Empire, Assyria, and Babylonia
Sumer emerged as the civilization of Lower Mesopotamia out of the prehistoric Ubaid period (mid-6th millennium BC) in
the Early Bronze Age (Uruk period). Classical Sumer ended with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC.
Following the Gutian period, the Ur III kingdom was once again able to unite large parts of southern and central
Mesopotamia under a single ruler in the 21st century. It may have eventually disintegrated due to Amorite incursions.
The Amorite dynasty of Isin persisted until c. 1600 BC, when southern Mesopotamia was united under Kassite Babylonian
rule.</p>

<h3 class="Prehistory">Prehistory</h3>
<p class="pre">Between 65,000 BC and 35,000 BC, northern Iraq was home to a Neanderthal culture, archaeological remains of which have
been discovered at Shanidar Cave.[3] During 1957–1961, Shanidar Cave was excavated by Ralph Solecki and his team from
Columbia University, uncovering nine skeletons of Neanderthal man of varying ages and states of preservation (labelled
Shanidar I–IX). A tenth individual was later discovered by M. Zeder during examination of a faunal assemblage from the
site at the Smithsonian Institution. The remains seemed to suggest that Neanderthals had funeral ceremonies, burying
their dead with flowers (although the flowers are now thought to be a modern contaminant), and that they took care of
injured and elderly individuals.

This region is also the location of a number of pre-Neolithic burials, dating from approximately 11,000 BC.[4] Since
approximately 10,000 BC, Iraq, together with a large part of the Fertile Crescent, was a center of a Neolithic culture
known as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), where agriculture and cattle breeding appeared for the first time. In Iraq,
this period has been excavated at sites like M'lefaat and Nemrik 9. The following Neolithic period, PPNB, is represented
by rectangular houses. At the time of the pre-pottery Neolithic, people used vessels made of stone, gypsum, and burnt
lime (Vaisselle blanche). Finds of obsidian tools from Anatolia are evidence of early trade relations. Further important
sites of human advancement were Jarmo (circa 7100 BC),[4] a number of sites belonging to the Halaf culture, and Tell
al-'Ubaid, the type site of the Ubaid period (between 6500 BC and 3800 BC).[5]</p>
